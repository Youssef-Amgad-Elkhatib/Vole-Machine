# üíª Vole Machine Simulator

## 	üìñ Overview
The **Vole Machine Simulator** is a virtual representation of a Vole Machine using C++, a simple computing system that executes instructions using a simulated CPU, RAM, and registers. This project provides an environment for executing Vole Machine instructions, manipulating memory, and simulating computational processes.

</br>

## ‚ú® Features
- **Instruction Execution**: Implements Vole Machine instruction set.
- **Memory Management**: 16x16 RAM matrix for storing data.
- **Registers**: 16 registers for temporary storage and calculations.
- **CPU Simulation**: Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle for running instructions.
